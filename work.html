        <h1>How Plagiarism Checker works?</h1>
        <p>
            Our Plagiarism Checker utilizes TF-IDF vectorization combined with cosine similarity to analyze text similarity effectively. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
        </p>
        <h2>1. TF-IDF Vectorization</h2>
        <p>
            TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). The process involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Term Frequency (TF):</strong> This measures how frequently a term appears in a document. The more times a word appears, the higher its TF value.</li>
            <li><strong>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):</strong> This measures how important a term is across all documents in the corpus. Rare terms across documents get higher IDF values.</li>
            <li><strong>Vectorization:</strong> Each document is transformed into a vector in a multi-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term from the corpus, weighted by its TF-IDF score.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Cosine Similarity</h2>   
        <p>
            Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two vectors are, regardless of their magnitude. It calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. The steps include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vector Comparison:</strong> Once the documents are vectorized using TF-IDF, cosine similarity compares these vectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Similarity Score:</strong> The cosine similarity score ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates identical documents, 0 indicates no similarity, and -1 indicates completely opposite documents.</li>  
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Plagiarism Detection</h2>
        <p>
            By combining TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, our Plagiarism Checker can effectively identify similarities between the user's text and reference documents. A high cosine similarity score suggests potential plagiarism, allowing users to take appropriate actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This method provides a robust and efficient way to detect text similarity, making it a valuable tool for educators, writers, and researchers.
